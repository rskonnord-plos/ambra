<h2>Violation of These Terms of Use</h2>

<p>PLoS reserves the right to investigate and prosecute violations of any of these Terms of Use to the fullest extent of the law.

<h2>Notification of Claims of Infringement</h2>

<p>If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or your intellectual property rights have otherwise been violated, please notify <strong>plos [at] plos.org</strong>.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

<p>YOUR USE OF THE PLoS SITES OR ANY WEB SITE TO WHICH THEY ARE LINKED IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  THE PLoS SITES AND THEIR CONTENT ARE PROVIDED FOR USE ON AN "AS-IS" AND "AS-AVAILABLE" BASIS.  PLoS MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE PLoS SITES OR THEIR CONTENTS AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT RELATING TO THE PLoS SITES, THEIR CONTENT OR ANY WEB SITE TO WHICH THEY ARE LINKED.</p>

<p>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM PLoS OR THROUGH OR FROM THE PLoS SITES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TERMS OF USE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, PLoS STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY ANY MEDICAL TREATMENT INFORMATION UPON WHICH YOU CHOOSE TO RELY.</p>

<h2>Indemnification</h2>

<p>You agree to indemnify and hold PLoS, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders, or other partners and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorney fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the PLoS Sites, your connection to the PLoS Sites, your violation of these Terms of Use, your violation of any rights of another, or any breach of the foregoing representations, warranties, and covenants.  The user is solely responsible for his or her actions when using the PLoS Sites, including, but not limited to, costs incurred for Internet access.  PLoS reserves the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.

<h2>Special Considerations for International Use</h2>

<p>Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct.  Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.</p>

<h2>General Terms</h2>

<p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and PLoS and govern your use of the PLoS Sites, superseding any prior agreements between you and PLoS (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Use) and any prior representations by PLoS.  These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflicts of law principles.  The failure of PLoS to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  If any provision of the Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect.  You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action brought against PLoS and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders, or other partners and employees, arising out of or related to use of the PLoS Sites or the Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.  The section titles in the Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
