  <h2>1. Post-Publication Review</h2>

  <p>The PLoS Web site employs a system for the assessment of articles that combines
   pre- and post-publication peer review. There are three major components to post-publication review:</p>

  <@s.url action="ratingGuidelines" namespace="/static" includeParams="none" id="rateGuideURL"/>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> Notes apply to a specific point in the Web version of the article text and should be used to highlight a minor point, to make additions or clarifications, or to identify and link to material, including more extensive discussions, presented elsewhere. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Comments:</strong> Comments are of a more general nature and can also be added to the article, leading to threaded discussions concerning the content, conclusions, and consequences of a specific article.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ratings:</strong> Users can assign individual ratings to articles, which are then aggregated to provide overall ratings and rankings of articles. Users are not allowed to rate more than once, but can revise their rating. For more details, see 
      <@s.a href="${rateGuideURL}" title="Guidelines for Rating">Guidelines for Ratings</@s.a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Authors of all Notes, Comments, and Ratings will be identified.</p>

  <a id="terms" name="terms"></a>
  <h2>2. Terms of Use</h2>

  <@s.url action="terms" namespace="/static" includeParams="none" id="termsURL"/>
  <p>All Notes, Comments, Ratings and other post-publication activity in the PLoS Web sites are subject to the <@s.a href="${termsURL}" title="Terms of Use">PLoS Terms of Use</@s.a>. </p>

  <a id="who" name="who"></a>
  <h2>3. Who Can Contribute?</h2>

  <p>All registered users are able to add Notes, Comments, and Ratings to any article. Anyone can register as a user. Users are required to unambiguously identify themselves and to supply a valid e-mail address in order to register. Registration information will be kept strictly confidential by PLoS staff unless otherwise indicated. PLoS reserves the right to suspend the privileges of any registered user. Discussion and ratings are not anonymous.</p>

  <a id="notes" name="notes"></a>
  <h2>4. How to Add and View Notes</h2>

  <p>To make a Note, first make sure you are logged into the Web site. Highlight the text to be annotated, and then click the "Add a note to the text" link in the right-hand navigation menu of the article. The drop-down list should already have "Note" selected.  If it is not, then select "Note" from the drop-down list. Enter a title and text for your Note in the appropriate boxes. When you are satisfied with the text, click "Post" to attach the Note to the article. Any correctly formed URLs in the Note text field will automatically become working links.</p>

  <p>Notes can be started at any point within the text, but for ease of reading we ask that you do not begin Notes in the middle of words.  We advise that longer Notes are first written in a word-processing program that allows for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into the Note field. </p>

  <p>Notes are represented by the small blue "clouds" within the online text. The number in the cloud indicates the number of Notes that begin at that point in the text. To see what selection of text is associated with a Note, run the cursor over the cloud, and the text will be transiently highlighted. Click on the cloud to view the title, date, contributor, and first 250 text characters of a Note. To view the complete text of a Note or the citation information of a Note, click "View/respond to this".</p>

  <a id="comments" name="comments"></a>
  <h2>5. How to Add and View Comments</h2>

  <p>To add a general Comment about the article as a whole, first make sure you are logged into the Web site. To create a Comment, click the "Make a general comment" link in the right-hand navigation menu of the article. Enter a title and text for your comment in the appropriate boxes.</p>

  <p>We advise that Comments are first written in a word-processing program that allows for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into the Comment field. When you are satisfied with the text, click "Post" to attach the Comment to the article. Any correctly formed URLs in the Comment text field will automatically become working links. </p>
  
  <p>To view all Comments and Notes on an article, along with any replies, click the "View/join ongoing discussions" link in the right-hand navigation menu of the article.</p>

 <a id="corrections" name="corrections"></a>
  <h2>6. How to Add and View Corrections</h2>
  
  <p>Authors and other users can post two kinds of Corrections: Minor Corrections and Formal Corrections.  Minor Corrections indicate small errors and clarifications to the article, whereas Formal Corrections are reserved for errors that significantly affect the utility or understanding of the article.  Formal Corrections are also sent to PubMed Central and PubMed. In both cases, the decision to indicate a posting as a Minor or Formal Correction is the responsibility of PLoS staff. </p>
  
  <p>To make a Correction, first make sure you are logged into the Web site. Highlight the text to be corrected, and then click the "Add a note to the text" link in the right-hand navigation menu of the article. Select "Correction" from the drop-down list.  Enter a title and text for your Correction in the appropriate boxes. When you are satisfied with the text, click "Post" to attach the Correction to the article. </p>

  <p>The Correction will initially appear as a Note but will be promptly reviewed by PLoS staff.  After the Note is reviewed, it will either stay as a Note or be changed to a Minor Correction or Formal Correction. Once a Note is changed to a Correction, the Correction is represented by a small red triangle "cloud" within the online text. </p>

  <p>The number in the cloud indicates the number of Corrections that begin at that point in the text. To see what selection of text is associated with a Correction, run the cursor over the cloud, and the text will be transiently highlighted. Click on the cloud to view the title, date, contributor, and first 250 text characters of a Correction. To view the complete text of a Correction or the citation information of a Correction, click "View/respond to this".</p>

  <p>Formal Corrections are also listed above the title of the article.  The title of the Formal Correction and a link to the Formal Corrections appear in this block.</p>

  <a id="responding" name="responding"></a>
  <h2>7. Responding to Notes, Comments, and Corrections</h2>

  <p>To respond to a Note, Comment, or Correction click the "Respond to this Posting" link in the bottom-right corner of the window. Enter a title and text for your response in the appropriate boxes. We advise that responses first are written in a word-processing program that allows for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into the comment field. When you are satisfied with the text, click "Post" to attach the response to the Note, Comment, or Correction. Any correctly formed URLs in the response text field will automatically become working links.</p>

  <p>Following this procedure, an unlimited number of branching threads can be anchored to an initial Note, Comment, or Correction. If any contribution is removed following moderation, all subsequent responses along its thread will also be removed. </p>

  <a id="goodpractice" name="goodpractice"></a>
  <h2>8. Good Practice</h2>

  <p>All contributions must conform to the norms of civilized scientific discussion. Any contributions that do not meet these standards will be removed. Any users who consistently transgress these conventions will have their user privileges removed.</p>

  <p>A partial list of discussion standards includes the following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Language that is insulting, inflammatory, or obscene will not be tolerated.</li>
    <li>Unsupported assertions or statements should be avoided. Comments must be evidence-based, not
    authority-based.</li>
    <li>When previously published studies are cited, they must be accurately referenced and,
    where possible, a DOI and link to a publicly accessible version supplied.</li>
    <li>Unpublished data should be provided with sufficient methodological detail for those data
    to be assessed. Alternatively, a permanent Web link to such information should be provided.</li>
    <li>Arguments based on belief are to be avoided. For example the assertion, "I don't believe
    the results in Figure 2." must be supported.</li>
    <li>Discussions should be confined to the demonstrable content of articles and should avoid
    speculation about the motivations or prejudices of authors. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>PLoS is the final arbiter of the suitability of content for inclusion in the PLoS Web sites.</p>

  <a id="inappropriatecontent" name="inappropriatecontent"></a>
  <h2>9. Requesting Review of Inappropriate Content</h2>

  <p>We encourage you to request review of a Note or Comment you believe to be inappropriate using the "Request review" link in the bottom-right corner of the window. Indicate why the content should be reviewed ("Spam," "Offensive," "Inappropriate," or "Other"), enter additional information in the text box, and click "Submit". PLoS staff will investigate the content, which may involve consulting external experts if necessary. Any content that PLoS staff deem to be inappropriate will be removed. Any users who consistently post inappropriate material will have their user privileges removed. If any contribution is removed, all subsequent responses along its thread will also be removed.</p>
