<a name="confidentiality"></a>
<h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>
<p>The review process is strictly confidential and should be treated as such by reviewers. Because the author may have chosen to exclude some people from this process, no one not directly involved with the manuscript, including colleagues or other experts in the field, should be consulted by the reviewer unless such consultations have first been discussed with the AE.</p>

<a name="timely"></a>
<h2>7. Timely Review</h2>
<p><em>PLoS Genetics</em> believes that an efficient editorial process that results in timely publication provides a valuable service both to authors and to the scientific community at large. We therefore request that reviewers respond promptly, usually within ten days of receipt of a manuscript. If reviewers need more time, we request that they contact us promptly so that we can keep the authors informed as appropriate.</p>
