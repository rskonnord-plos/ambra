<a name="openaccess"></a>
<h2>2. Open Access</h2>

<a name="publicationcharges"></a>
<h2>3. Publication Charges</h2>

<a name="criteria"></a> 
<h2>4. Criteria for Publication</h2>
 
<p>To be considered for publication in <em>PLoS Genetics</em>, any given manuscript must satisfy the following criteria:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Originality</li>
<li>High importance to researchers in the field</li>
<li>Broad interest to researchers in genetics and genomics</li>
<li>Rigorous methodology</li>
<li>Substantial evidence for its conclusions</li>
</ul>

<a name="editorial"></a>
<h2>5. Overview of Editorial Process</h2>
<p>Our aim is to provide all authors with an efficient, courteous, and constructive editorial process. To achieve its required level of quality, <em>${journal_name}</em> is highly selective in the manuscripts that it publishes; rejection rates are high. To ensure the fairest and most objective decision-making, the editorial process is run as a partnership between the <em>${journal_name}</em> <a href="eic.action">Editor-in-Chief</a>, a Deputy Editor, a team of Section Editors (SEs), and a group of academic experts who act as <a href="edboard.action">Associate Editors</a> (AEs). These individuals are leaders in their fields and represent the full breadth of genetics and genomics.</p>
 
<p>Submitted manuscripts are first reviewed by the EIC, Deputy Editor, or one of the SEs, who may decide to reject the paper or send it on to an AE for further review. The AE is most often a member of the <em>${journal_name}</em> Editorial Board, but occasionally a guest of the Board is invited to serve in this capacity. The AE evaluates the paper and decides whether it describes a sufficient body of work to support a major advance in a particular field. If so, the paper is sent out for external peer review, at which stage the technical and scientific merits of the work are carefully considered. Once the reviews have been received and considered by the editors, a decision letter to the corresponding author is drafted and sent.</p>

 
<p>The decision will be within one of the following categories:
 	<ul>
	<li>Reject</li> 
 	<li>Major revision</li> 
 	<li>Minor revision</li> 
 	<li>Accept</li> 
	</ul>
</p>
	

<a name="presubs"></a>
<h2>6. Presubmission Inquiries</h2>
<p>When authors are unsure whether their work satisfies the basic requirements for publication in <em>${journal_name}</em>, we are happy to consider presubmission inquiries. If you would like to submit an informal presubmission inquiry to see if a manuscript is appropriate in principle, please login or register for a new account within our <a href="${jms_link}">online submission system</a>, choosing 'Submit Presubmission Inquiry' from the list of Author Tasks. Required for all Presubmission Inquiries are contact information, a cover letter, and an abstract.</p>
 
<p>Responses to these inquiries are normally provided within a few working days. Responses may take longer if consultation between members of the editorial board is required. If you are invited to <a href="${jms_link}">submit your manuscript</a>, we will do our best to provide an expeditious initial assessment of the complete manuscript for suitability and then, if warranted, external peer review.</p>
 
<a name="preparation"></a>
<h2>7. Preparation of Research Manuscripts</h2>
<p><em>${journal_name}</em> publishes original research that clearly demonstrates novelty, importance to a particular field, biological significance, and conclusions that are justified by the study.</p> 

<p>Our aim is to make the editorial process rigorous and consistent, and to offer the best possible support to our authors throughout this process. Authors are encouraged to decide how best to present their ideas, results, and conclusions. The writing style should be concise and accessible. Editors may make suggestions for how to achieve this, as well as suggestions for cuts or additions that could be made to the article to strengthen the argument.</p>

<p>Although we encourage submissions from around the globe, we require that manuscripts be submitted in English. As a step towards overcoming language barriers, we encourage authors fluent in other languages to provide copies of their full articles or abstracts in other languages. Translations should be submitted as supporting information and listed, together with other supporting information files, at the end of the article text.</p>


<a name="organization"></a>
<h3>Organization of the Manuscript</h3>
 
<p>Most articles published in <em>${journal_name}</em> are organized into the following sections: <a href="#title">Title</a>, <a href="#authors">Authors</a>, <a href="#affiliations">Affiliations</a>, <a href="#abstract">Abstract</a>, <a href="#authorsummary">Author Summary</a>, <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>, <a href="#results">Results</a>, <a href="#discussion">Discussion</a>, <a href="#materials_methods">Materials and Methods</a>, <a href="#acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</a>, <a href="#references">References</a>, <a href="#figurelegends">Figure Legends</a>, and <a href="#tables">Tables</a>. Uniformity in format facilitates the experience of readers and users of the journal. To provide flexibility, however, authors are also able to include the Materials and Methods section before the Results section or before the Discussion section. Please also note that the Results and Discussion can be combined into one Results/Discussion section. Although we have no firm length restrictions for the entire manuscript, we urge authors to present and discuss their findings concisely.</p>


<a name="title"></a>
<h4>Title (150 characters or less)</h4>

<p>The title should be specific to the project, yet concise. It should be comprehensible to readers outside your field. Avoid specialist abbreviations, if possible. Titles should be presented in title case, meaning that all words except for prepositions, articles, and conjunctions should be capitalized. Please also provide a brief &quot;running head&quot; of no more than 30 characters.</p>
 
<p>Example: <br />
Detection of Specific Sequences among DNA Fragments Separated by Gel Electrophoresis. </p>


<a name="authors"></a><a name="affiliations"></a>
<h4>Authors and Affiliations</h4>

${authors_and_affiliations}

<a name="abstract"></a>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The abstract of the paper should be succinct; it should not exceed 250-300 words. Authors should mention the techniques used without going into methodological detail and should summarize the most important results. The abstract is conceptually divided into the following three sections for the purpose of submission and review: Background, Methodology/Principal Findings, and Conclusions/Significance. While the text of the abstract in the submission form and article file should be exactly the same, please do not apply these distinct headings to the abstract within the article file. Please do not include any citations and avoid specialist abbreviations.</p>

<a name="authorsummary"></a>
<h4>Author Summary</h4>
<p>We ask that all authors of research articles include a 150-200 word non-technical summary of the work as part of the manuscript to immediately follow the abstract. This text is subject to editorial change, should be written in the first-person voice, and should be distinct from the scientific abstract. Aim to highlight where your work fits within a broader context; present the significance or possible implications of your work simply and objectively; and avoid the use of acronyms and complex terminology wherever possible. The goal is to make your findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. Authors may benefit from consulting with a science writer or press officer to ensure they effectively communicate their findings to a general audience. Examples are available at:<p>
<p><a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.0030124#special">Complex Seizure Disorder Caused by <em>Brunol4</em> Deficiency in Mice</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.0030115#special">Genome-Wide Association Scan Shows Genetic Variants in the <em>FTO</em> Gene Are Associated with Obesity-Related Traits</a></p>

<a name="introduction"></a>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The introduction should put the focus of the manuscript into a broader context. As you compose the introduction, think of readers who are not experts in this field. Include a brief review of the key literature. If there are relevant controversies or disagreements in the field, they should be mentioned so that a non-expert reader can delve into these issues further. The introduction should conclude with a brief statement of the overall aim of the experiments and a comment about whether that aim was achieved.</p> 

<a name="results"></a>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>The results section should provide details of all of the experiments that are required to support the conclusions of the paper. There is no specific word limit for this section, but details of experiments that are peripheral to the main thrust of the article and that detract from the focus of the article should not be included. The section may be divided into subsections, each with a concise subheading. Large datasets, including raw data, should be submitted as supporting files; these are published online alongside the accepted article. The results section should be written in the past tense.</p> 

<a name="discussion"></a>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The discussion should spell out the major conclusions of the work along with some explanation or speculation on the significance of these conclusions. How do the conclusions affect the existing assumptions and models in the field? How can future research build on these observations? What are the key experiments that must be done? The discussion should be concise and tightly argued. The results and discussion may be combined into one section, if desired.</p>

<a name="materials_methods"></a> 
<h4>Materials and Methods (also called Methods or Models)</h4>
<p>This section should provide enough detail for reproduction of the findings. Protocols for new methods should be included, but well-established protocols may simply be referenced. While we do encourage authors to submit all appendices, detailed protocols, or details of the algorithms for newer or less well-established methods, please do so as Supporting Information files. These are not included in the typeset manuscript, but are downloadable and fully searchable from the HTML version of the article. </p>

<a name="other"></a>
<h2>9. Interviews, Reviews, and Special Reports</h2> 

<p>In addition to weekly research articles, <em>PLoS Genetics</em> also provides a forum for the publication of articles of broad interest to the genetics and genomics community.
These articles are <strong>by invitation only</strong>; however, we encourage you to send your feedback and ideas to ${email}.
</p>

<h4>Interviews</h4>
<p>Jane Gitschier brings her unique conversational style to an ongoing collection of interviews of interesting people in the world of science and genetics &mdash; from Nicholas Wade to Sir John Sulston, from David Botstein to Shirley Tilghman.</p>

<h4>Reviews</h4>
<p>These succinct, synthetic, well-focused, and engaging mini reviews should appeal to a broad genetics readership. Aim for no more than 2,500 words, 50 references, and two or three display items. The article will include an overview of the existing literature but should focus on the future: where is the field going; what exciting developments are expected?<p>

<p>Because these articles are by invitation only, the topic and scope will have been agreed with an editor. It is advisable to forward on a short summary or draft in advance of the full submission. Mini reviews are peer reviewed externally; if accepted for publication, a publication charge does not apply.</p>

<p>Structure the mini review as follows: Title, Authors, Affiliations, Abstract, Introduction, Main Text (broken into subsections as appropriate), Conclusions, Acknowledgments, References, Figure Legends, and Tables. Please refer to the information above about the specifics of manuscript, figure, and table preparation. Email ${email} if you are in any doubt about how our guidelines for research articles differ from those of mini reviews.</p>

<h4>Special Reports</h4>
<p><em>PLoS Genetics</em> editors occasionally recruit a special report of a conference or meeting. This article should be concise and well written, no longer than 1,500 words, with up to 2 display items. The style should be progressive and punchy, and the author should bring his or her own perspective or a particular theme to the report, engaging readers with a range of professional scientific interests and levels of experience. It should inform and inspire novice readers and experts alike by: identifying the overall purpose of the meeting; synthesizing the focus of the scientific discussion in key presentations; and, most importantly, explaining why this conference or meeting is relevant to and generated excitement in the larger scientific community.</p>
<p>Because these are by invitation only, the scope of the report will have been agreed with an editor. Authors should work closely with the recruiting editor, forwarding a draft for review before the final report is submitted. The report may or may not be subject to external peer review; if accepted for publication, a publication charge does not apply.</p>
<p>Please refer to the information above about the specifics of manuscript, figure, and table preparation and email ${email} if you are in any doubt about how our guidelines for research articles differ from those of special reports.</p>

<a name="embargoes"></a>
<h2>11. Blogs, Wikis, Embargoes, and the Media</h2>
<p>Authors are of course at liberty to present their findings at medical or scientific conferences ahead of publication. We recommend, however, that authors not contact the media or respond to such contact unless an article has been accepted for publication and an embargo date has been established. Respect for press embargoes will help to ensure that your work is reported accurately in the popular media. If a journalist has covered a piece of work ahead of publication, this will not affect consideration of the work for publication.
