<h1>About <em>${journal_name}</em></h1>

<p><em>PLoS Genetics</em> (eISSN 1553-7404, ISSN 1553-7390) is an open-access, peer-reviewed journal published weekly by the <a href="http://www.plos.org">Public Library of Science</a> (PLoS).</p>

<p><em>PLoS Genetics</em> is run by an international Editorial Board, headed by the Editor-in-Chief, <a href="eic.action">Wayne Frankel</a> (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, United States).</p>

<p>Articles published in <em>PLoS Genetics</em> are deposited in <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/">PubMed Central</a> and cited in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/entrez/">PubMed</a>.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>Genetics and genomics research has grown at a bewildering pace in the past 15 years. The techniques of these fields are being applied to a wealth of biological questions and experimental systems. <em>PLoS Genetics</em> reflects the full breadth and interdisciplinary nature of this research by publishing outstanding original contributions in all areas of biology.</p>
 
<p><em>PLoS Genetics</em> publishes human studies, as well as research on model organisms&#8212;from mice and flies, to plants and bacteria. Topics include (but are not limited to) gene discovery and function, population genetics, genome projects, comparative and functional genomics, medical genetics, cancer biology, evolution, gene expression, complex traits, chromosome biology, and epigenetics.</p>

<p>Please refer to our <a href="guidelines.action">Author Guidelines</a> when you are preparing your manuscripts for submission. If you are unsure whether your paper is suitable for <em>PLoS Genetics</em>, you can send a <a href="guidelines.action#presubs">Presubmission Inquiry</a>.</p>

<h2>Measuring Impact</h2>
<p>The impact factor is calculated in large part by how often a journal's papers have been cited in a particular year. <em>${journal_name}</em> has received its first impact factor of ${impact_factor} from Thomson Scientific, a preliminary figure based on just six months of published work in 2005. Although the impact factor cannot fully measure the value of published work or its wider influence, we are delighted with the response from and support of the genetics and genomics community and remain focused on our principal goal of publishing high-quality, substantive science. We also encourage contributors and readers to consider the wider issues surrounding the impact factor (see, for example, the <a href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030291" title="Read the PLoS Medicine Editorial">June 2006 editorial</a> in <em>PLoS Medicine</em>) and to participate in efforts to develop alternative metrics.</p>
