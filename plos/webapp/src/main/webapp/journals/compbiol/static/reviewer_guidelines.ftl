<a name="about"></a>
<h2>1. About <em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></h2>
<p><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em> features works of exceptional significance  that further our understanding of living systems at all scales&mdash;from  molecules and cells, to patient populations and ecosystems&mdash;through the  application of computational methods. Readers include life and  computational scientists, who can take the important findings presented  here to the next level of discovery.</p>
<p>Research articles that primarily describe new methods and offer only  limited biological insight will be considered only in those exceptional  instances in which the method is expected to significantly impact the  field of computational biology, typically making substantial  breakthroughs in areas of demonstrated importance. Research articles  modeling aspects of biological systems should demonstrate both  scientific novelty and profound new biological insights. Research  articles describing improved or routine methods, models, software, and  databases will not be considered by <em>PLoS Computational Biology</em>, and may  be more appropriate for <a href="http://www.plosone.org" title="Visit the PLoS ONE web site"><em>PLoS ONE</em></a>.</p>
<p>Generally, reliability and significance of biological discovery are  validated and enriched by experimental studies. Experimental validation  is not required for publication, however, nor does experimental  validation of a modest biological discovery render a manuscript  suitable for <em>PLoS Computational Biology</em>.</p>

<a name="criteria"></a> 
<h2>2. Criteria for Publication</h2>
<p>To be considered for publication in <em>PLoS Computational Biology</em>, any given manuscript must satisfy the following criteria: </p>
<ul>
<li>Originality</li>
<li>High importance to researchers in computational biology</li>
<li>Significant biological insight and general interest to life scientists</li>
<li>Rigorous methodology</li>
<li>Substantial evidence for its conclusions</li> 
</ul>
<p>Manuscripts also must be well written to ensure clear and effective presentation of the work and key findings. </p>

<p>Finally, all manuscripts submitted to ${journal_name} must adhere to our <a href="policies.action" title="Go to Editorial and Publishing Policies">Editorial and Publishing Policies</a> and <a href="guidelines.action" title="Go to Author Guidelines">Author Guidelines</a>.</p>



<a name="review"></a> 
<h2>3. The Review Process</h2>
<p>Submitted manuscripts are first reviewed by the <a href="eic.action">Editor-in-Chief</a> (EIC), or one of the Deputy Editors, who may decide to reject the paper or send it on to an Associate Editor (AE) for further review. The AE is most often a member of the <em>${journal_name}</em> <a href="edboard.action">Editorial Board</a>, but occasionally a guest of the Board is invited to serve in this capacity. The AE evaluates the paper and decides whether it describes a sufficient body of work to support a major advance in a particular field.  If the AE does not judge the manuscript to be suitable for the journal, alone or in consultation with other editors, the manuscript may be rejected outright, without external peer review, with the reasons outlined in the decision letter. If the AE does judge the manuscript to be suitable for the journal, it will then be subject to external peer review.</p>
<p>The opinions of up to 5 experts are sought to evaluate the manuscript fully with respect to its significance, relevance, quality, and clarity.  On receipt of all reviewer comments, AEs, in consultation with other members of the Board and with the Editor-in-Chief or Deputy Editor, weigh all comments before rendering a decision.  </p>

<p>Based on the review comments and potentially further consultation amongst other editors, a decision is rendered by the AE and co-signed by the EIC, or one of the Deputy Editors, who will send the decision to the corresponding author.</p>

<p>Possible decisions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reject</li>
<li>Major Revision</li>
<li>Minor Revision</li>
<li>Accept</li>
</ul>

<p>If reviewers appear to disagree fundamentally, the editors may choose to share all the reviews with each of the reviewers and by this means elicit additional comments that may help to make a decision. The editor may also choose to consult with other editors on the Board. That said, although the reviewers\' comments and opinions on the manuscript are very important, decisions are not necessarily made according to majority rule. Instead, the editors evaluate the recommendations and comments of the reviewers alongside comments by the authors and material that may not have been made available to those reviewers. The decision, along with the full set of review comments, is shared with the reviewers after a decision has been made.</p>
 
<p>When a paper has been revised in response to the review, or when authors appeal against a decision, we often ask the reviewers to offer additional comments. We request that reviewers make themselves available to provide such follow-up advice. We are nevertheless aware that reviewers do not wish to be involved in extended discussions over papers, and our goal is to keep such consultations to a minimum while still allowing authors a fair hearing.</p>

<h2>4. Reviewer Selection</h2>

<h2>5. Writing the Review</h2>

<a name="confidentiality"></a>
<h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>

<p>The review process is strictly confidential and should be treated as such by reviewers. Because the author may have chosen to exclude some people from this process, no one not directly involved with the manuscript, including colleagues or other experts in the field, should be consulted by the reviewer unless such consultations have first been discussed with the AE.</p> 


<a name="timely"></a>
<h2>7. Timely Review</h2>

<p><em>${journal_name}</em> believes that an efficient editorial process that results in timely publication provides a valuable service both to authors and to the scientific community at large. We therefore request that reviewers respond promptly, usually within 10 days to 2 weeks of their receipt of a manuscript. If reviewers need more time, or are unable to perform the review, we request they provide prompt notice and suggestions for 2 or 3 alternate qualified reviewers. </p>
