  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <h2>What is a PLoS Hub?</h2>
  <@s.url action="license" namespace="/static" includeParams="none" id="licenseURL"/>
  <p>
    A PLoS Hub is a window onto content in a specific field, and it will collect together
    <@s.a href="${licenseURL}" title="PLoS Hub | Open-Access License">open-access</@s.a>
    articles from many journals. A PLoS Hub allows a group of people who are interested in
    the same subject to share their opinions and knowledge and, ultimately, to build a
    dynamic, interactive community.

  <@s.url action="commentGuidelines" namespace="/static" includeParams="none" id="commentURL"/>
  <p>
    Open access is ideally suited to community building because everything published is
    available for anyone to <a href="http://www.plos.org/journals/creativeuses.html"
    title="PLoS.org | Creative Uses">download, print, and share, without restriction</a>.
    The interactive tools for <@s.a href="${rateGuideURL}" title="PLoS Hub | Rating Guidelines">rating</@s.a>,
    <@s.a href="${commentURL}" title="PLoS Hub | Comment Guidelines">annotating, and discussing</@s.a>
    articles included in the PLoS Hub allow users to enhance the value of research findings, to provide
    novel insights, and to accelerate scientific progress.
  </p>

  <h2>What kind of subjects will be covered?</h2>

  <p>
    PLoS Hubs can be long-term, focusing on topics such as breast cancer or conservation, or transient,
    focusing on a specific project such as a major genome project or a new research challenge, such as
    the SARS epidemic. Regardless of the lifetime of the PLoS Hub, the articles that appear there will
    be open-access and also available from the Web site of the journal in which they were originally
    published.
  </p>

  <h2>Why does the first PLoS Hub cover clinical trials?</h2>

  <p>
    Clinical trials research is a field in which the <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673606687084/fulltext" title="The Lancet | Clinical trial registration: transparency is the watchword [free registration required]">benefits of transparency</a> are well documented,
    which is why PLoS is committed to publishing the results of all clinical trials regardless of
    outcome, and making this essential information freely and publicly available.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can publish clinical trials research more effectively by merging <em>PLoS Clinical Trials</em>
    with <a href="http://www.plosone.org" title="PLoS ONE"><em>PLoS ONE</em></a>, and launching the
    PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials. For authors of clinical trials articles published in <em>PLoS ONE</em>,
    this brings these added benefits:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Faster turnaround times (acceptance to publication in as little as three weeks) </li>
    <li>Lower publication fees</li>
    <li>Interactive tools and functionality&#8212;ratings, annotation, and discussion threads</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What content can I see now in the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials?</h2>

  <p>
    The launch version of the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials collects together the articles that
    were published in <em>PLoS Clinical Trials</em>, plus clinical trials published in
    <em>PLoS ONE</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>What content will be included in future in the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials?</h2>

  <p>
    The PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials will contain clinical trials articles from
    <a href="http://www.plosntds.org/" title="PLoS NTDs"><em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em></a>
    as soon as this journal is launched (Fall 2007). Shortly after that we will start to add articles
    from all of the PLoS journals, but it doesn't stop there. One of the great benefits of open access
    is that content can be reused without restriction, so ultimately, relevant open-access articles
    from other journals will also be included. In time, the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials will evolve
    into a comprehensive resource of information relevant to anyone interested in clinical trials.
  </p>

  <h2>Can I submit a paper to the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials?</h2>
  <@s.url action="checklist" namespace="/static" includeParams="none" id="cklistURL"/>
  <p>
    No&#8212;a PLoS Hub is not a journal. You should continue to
    <@s.a href="${cklistURL}" title="PLoS Hub | Submit Your Paper">submit your work to the
    PLoS journal that best suits your needs</@s.a>. If you submit your clinical trials paper to
    <em>PLoS ONE</em> it will automatically appear in the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials. If you submit
    your work to another PLoS journal a link to the paper will be provided on the PLoS Hub homepage,
    and the article will be fully incorporated into the PLoS Hub in the coming months.
  </p>

  <h2>Is the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials a work in progress?</h2>

  <p>
    Absolutely. We will be
    adding more PLoS content, as well as open-access content from other journals, and we will be
    launching more PLoS Hubs on different topics. We will also be adding new functionality to the site,
    and are launching the PLoS Hubs in "beta" so that we can <a href="${feedbackURL}" title="PLoS Hub | Send Feedback">work with the community to help shape this</a>
    and future PLoS Hubs.
