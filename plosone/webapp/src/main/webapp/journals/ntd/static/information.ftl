<h1><em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> Journal Information</h1>

<h2>About <em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em></h2>

<p class="intro"><em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> (eISSN 1935-2735) is the first open-access journal devoted to the world's most <a href="scope.action">neglected tropical diseases</a> (NTDs), such as elephantiasis, river blindness, leprosy, hookworm, schistosomiasis, and African sleeping sickness. The journal publishes high-quality, peer-reviewed research on all scientific, medical, and public-health aspects of these forgotten diseases affecting the world's forgotten people.</p> 

<p><em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is particularly keen to publish research from authors in countries where the NTDs are endemic. It aims to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Provide a forum for the NTDs community of scientific investigators, health practitioners, control experts, and advocates to publish their findings in an open-access format</li>
	<li>Promote and profile the efforts of scientists, health practitioners, and public-health experts from <a href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=slideshow&amp;type=figure&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020336" title="Geographic Overlap of the Neglected Tropical Diseases" target="_blank">endemic countries</a>, and build science and health capacity in those countries</li>
	<li>Highlight the global public-health importance of the NTDs and advocate for the plight of the poor who suffer from these diseases in endemic countries</li>
</ul>


<p><em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is published online by the Public Library of Science (PLoS), a nonprofit organization. The journal's start-up phase is supported by a grant from the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/GlobalHealth" title="Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation: Global Health Program">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p><em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is devoted to the pathology, epidemiology, treatment, control, and prevention of the NTDs, as well as public policy relevant to this group of diseases. </p>

<p>The NTDs are defined as a group of poverty-promoting chronic infectious diseases, which primarily occur in rural areas and poor urban areas of low-income and middle-income countries. They are poverty-promoting because of their impact on child health and development, pregnancy, and worker productivity, as well as their stigmatizing features.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>

<h3>Original Research Papers</h3>

<p>Research articles consider all aspects of the NTDs, including their pathogenesis, clinical features, pharmacology and treatment, diagnosis, epidemiology, vector biology, and vaccinology and prevention. Demographic, ecological and social determinants, public health, and policy aspects of these diseases (including cost-effectiveness analyses) are also a priority. <em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> is pleased to publish relevant in vitro and animal studies as well as human investigations. The journal is organized to provide additional support for authors from endemic countries, and such authors are particularly encouraged to submit their research to <em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>. Academic editors, supported by expert peer-reviewers, will select for publication those studies that drive their respective fields forward. </p>

<h2>Publication Charges</h2>

<p>To provide open access, PLoS journals use a business model in which our expenses-including those of peer review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving-are recovered in part by charging a publication fee to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. For <em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> the publication fee is US$2100. Authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support/instmembers.html" title="PLoS.org | Institutional Members">Institutional Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee.</p>

<p>We offer a complete or partial fee waiver for authors who do not have funds to cover publication fees. Editors and reviewers have no access to payment information, and hence inability to pay will not influence the decision to publish a paper.</p>
