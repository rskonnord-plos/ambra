  <h2>What is the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials?</h2>

  <p>
    It's the first PLoS Hub&#8212;a window onto content in a specific field. PLoS Hubs will
    collect together open-access articles from many journals, and will allow a group of people
    who are interested in the same subject to share their opinions and knowledge and ultimately
    to build a dynamic interactive community.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are launching the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials in "beta" so that we can work with the
    community to help shape this and future PLoS Hubs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials collects together clinical trials research articles, and
    demonstrates our commitment to publishing the results of all properly conducted and reported
    clinical trials regardless of outcome, and making this essential information freely and
    publicly available.
  </p>

  <p>
    The launch of the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials in August 2007 also completes
    <a href="http://www.plos.org/journals/clinicaltrials-one.html"
    title="PLoS.org | PLoS Clinical Trials is moving to PLoS ONE">the merger of <em>PLoS
    Clinical Trials</em> with <em>PLoS ONE</em></a>. Authors publishing clinical trials research
    in PLoS ONE will benefit from very rapid publication (acceptance to publication in less than
    three weeks) and a more modest publication fee (US$1250). The entire community will benefit
    from new interactive features: commentary, annotation, and article ratings.
  </p>

  <h2>What do authors need to know?</h2>

  <@s.url action="checklist" namespace="/static" includeParams="none" id="cklistURL"/>
  <p>
    That your clinical trials research can be included in the PLoS Hub, but that the PLoS Hub
    itself is not a journal. You should continue to
    <@s.a href="${cklistURL}" title="PLoS Hub | Submit Your Paper">submit your clinical trials
    research to the PLoS journal that best suits your needs</@s.a>. If accepted, your article will
    be published in the journal that accepted it; clinical trials research accepted into
    <em>PLoS ONE</em> will also automatically appear in the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials. If you
    submit your work to another PLoS journal a link to the paper will be provided on the PLoS
    Hub homepage, and the article will be fully incorporated into the PLoS Hub in the coming
    months. Registered subscribers to the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials will be alerted to the
    publication of your article, along with subscribers to the journal where your article was
    published.
  </p>

  <h2>What do users need to know?</h2>

  <@s.url action="ratingGuidelines" namespace="/static" includeParams="none" id="rateGuideURL"/>
  <@s.url action="commentGuidelines" namespace="/static" includeParams="none" id="commentGuideURL"/>
  <p>
    That the PLoS Hub is a convenient meeting place for those interested in this field to
    engage "hands on" with the content. Use the tools that are available to
    <@s.a href="${rateGuideURL}" title="PLoS Hub | Rating Guidelines">rate</@s.a>,
    <@s.a href="${commentGuideURL}" title="PLoS Hub | Comment Guidelines">annotate,
    and discuss</@s.a> the articles. Share your views, see what other people think, and
    <a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/241" title="PLoS Blog  | Rate Early, Rate Often">never
    read an article without rating it</a>!
  </p>

  <h2>What do we all need to know?</h2>

  <p>
    That this is just the start. For now, the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials collects together
    the articles from <em>PLoS Clinical Trials</em>, plus clinical trials published in
    <a href="http://www.plosone.org/" title="PLoS ONE"><em>PLoS ONE</em></a> and the
    soon-to-be-launched <a href="http://www.plosntds.org/" title="PLoS NTDs"><em>PLoS Neglected
    Tropical Diseases</em></a>. Over the coming months we will be adding articles from all of
    the PLoS journals to the PLoS Hub. One of the great benefits of open access is that content
    can be reused without restriction, so ultimately, relevant open-access articles from other
    journals will also be included. In time, the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials will evolve into
    a comprehensive resource of information relevant to anyone interested in clinical trials.
