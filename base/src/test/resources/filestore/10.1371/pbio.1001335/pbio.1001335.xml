        <p>Amyloidogenic neurodegenerative diseases are incurable conditions with high social impact that are typically
          caused by specific, largely disordered proteins. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive
          to established techniques. A favored hypothesis postulates that a critical conformational change in the
          monomer (an ideal therapeutic target) in these “neurotoxic proteins” triggers the pathogenic cascade. We use
          force spectroscopy and a novel methodology for unequivocal single-molecule identification to demonstrate a
          rich conformational polymorphism in the monomer of four representative neurotoxic proteins. This polymorphism
          strongly correlates with amyloidogenesis and neurotoxicity: it is absent in a fibrillization-incompetent
          mutant, favored by familial-disease mutations and diminished by a surprisingly promiscuous inhibitor of the
          critical monomeric β-conformational change, neurotoxicity, and neurodegeneration. Hence, we postulate that
          specific mechanostable conformers are the cause of these diseases, representing important new early-diagnostic
          and therapeutic targets. The demonstrated ability to inhibit the conformational heterogeneity of these
          proteins by a single pharmacological agent reveals common features in the monomer and suggests a common
          pathway to diagnose, prevent, halt, or reverse multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's are currently incurable. They are caused by
          different proteins that, under certain circumstances, aggregate and become toxic as we grow older, but the
          molecular events underlying this process remain unclear. The lack of a well-defined structure, and the
          tendency of these “neurotoxic proteins” to aggregate make them difficult to study using conventional
          techniques. Here, we use an established single-molecule manipulation technique combined with a new
          protein-engineering strategy to show that all these proteins can adopt a rich collection of structures
          (conformers) that includes a high proportion of mechanostable conformers, which are associated with toxicity
          and disease. We also find that a known drug can block the formation of these mechanostable structures in
          different neurotoxic proteins. We suggest that the most mechanostable conformers, or their precursors, may
          trigger the pathogenic cascade that results in toxicity. We thus propose that these mechanostable structures
          are ideal targets for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of these fatal diseases.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Amyloid-related neurodegenerative diseases are incurable disorders that are currently classified as
        conformational diseases (a subset of the proteinopathies). These diseases are thought to be primarily caused by
        an unknown conformational change in specific proteins, termed “neurotoxic proteins” (NPs), which confers them a
        cytotoxic gain of function. This initial transition in the soluble monomer triggers a series of events that lead
        to the formation of small soluble oligomers and protofibrils, and ultimately the generation of highly ordered
        fibrillar insoluble aggregates. More than 20 of these NPs have been found to be intrinsically disordered
        proteins (IDPs). Despite the fact that the monomers of NPs have different primary and, when folded, tertiary
        structures, their oligomers and aggregates share common structural properties<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                           rid="pbio.1001335-Chiti1">
          [1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Uversky1">[2]</xref>, including recognition by a
        conformational antibody<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Kayed1">[3]</xref>. Whereas the nature of the
        cytotoxic species and the molecular mechanisms involved in their misfolding and aggregation remain largely
        unknown, there is growing evidence that conformational changes preceding aggregation are fundamental in the
        molecular pathogenesis of these diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Chiti1">[1]</xref>. Furthermore,
        as the formation of monomeric misfolding intermediates is regarded as the earliest event in the pathogenic
        cascade, this process represents an ideal therapeutic target<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Nagai1">
          [4]</xref>.
      </p>
      <p>Remarkably, it was recently demonstrated that the key conformational change that endows amyloidogenesis occurs
        in the monomer, triggering aggregation and fibrillogenesis as well as cytotoxicity<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                rid="pbio.1001335-Nagai2">
          [5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Khan1">[7]</xref>. Thus, to understand the acquisition of
        toxic properties by NPs, the three-dimensional structure of this toxic monomeric conformer must be
        characterized. However, the propensity of monomers to aggregate in vitro hampers their structural analysis using
        classical high resolution techniques such as X-ray crystallography or solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
        Nevertheless, it was shown that some NPs are rich in α-helical<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Zahn1">
          [8]</xref>,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Ulmer1">[9]</xref>
        or disordered<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Danielsson1">[10]</xref>,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Mukrasch1">[11]</xref>
        segments. It must be noted that the oligomeric state of α-synuclein, the NP associated to Parkinson disease,
        remains controversial. Thus, while some reports validate it as a natively unfolded monomer<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                        rid="pbio.1001335-Fauvet1">
          [12]</xref>, other studies have shown, interestingly, that its potential native state is a dynamic α-helical
        tetramer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Bartels1">[13]</xref>,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Wang1">[14]</xref>
        that undergoes unfolding/folding cycles associated to its physiological function to promote SNARE complex
        formation in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Sdhof1">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, it was suggested
        that many alternative monomeric conformations may coexist in a dynamic equilibrium that progressively shifts
        toward conformers enriched in β-structure, which are thought to be the first toxic species<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                        rid="pbio.1001335-Uversky1">
          [2]</xref>. However, the inherent ensemble averaging of these techniques prevents the full complexity of
        monomer conformational equilibria from being elucidated and the fast fluctuations involved from being resolved.
        Moreover, solid-state NMR and X-ray crystallography can only provide structural information about the final
        species (i.e., amyloid fibers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Sawaya1">[16]</xref>).
      </p>
      <p>Bulk-based, theoretical, and single-molecule studies support the existence of conformational heterogeneity in
        intrinsically disordered NPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Chiti1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                     rid="pbio.1001335-James1">
          [17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Uversky2">[18]</xref>. However, the co-existence of
        several species in solution at equilibrium, some of which may be scarcely populated, makes analyzing IDPs a
        particularly challenging task using established biophysical techniques<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                    rid="pbio.1001335-ReceveurBrchot1">
          [19]</xref>. By contrast, single-molecule techniques provide a unique opportunity to tackle this problem being
        able to reveal monomeric conformers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Uversky2">[18]</xref>. Some of these
        techniques have already been used to monitor the activity and conformation of proteins with conformational
        plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Xie1">[20]</xref>, resolving fast fluctuations (20–300 ns) at
        the monomeric level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Ferreon1">[21]</xref>. Of the available techniques,
        nanomanipulation has two additional advantages. First, it allows the forces involved in stabilization of the
        intramolecular interactions to be directly measured (mechanical stability); and second, it enables the
        mechanical stability of a protein to be related with its conformation. In particular, atomic force microscopy
        (AFM)-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS, for short) shows remarkable potential to analyze the
        conformational equilibrium of monomers, and even to detect low-abundant conformers<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                rid="pbio.1001335-Uversky2">
          [18]</xref>. In principle, measuring the mechanostability of NPs using SMFS should be feasible, as the toxic
        gain of function of NPs parallels the acquisition of β-structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Chiti1">

        have been hindered by three serious problems. Firstly, standard polyproteins were used as single-molecule
        markers fused to the NP, and since the NP is placed in series with the marker repeats, the SMFS recordings
        obtained are typically contaminated in the proximal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001335-g001">Figure
          1</xref>), thereby compromising the reliability of the data obtained. Secondly, the amyloidogenic behavior of
        the NP fused to the polyprotein was not demonstrated. Finally, there is no convincing evidence demonstrating
        that the selected data originated from bona fide intramolecular interactions (rather than intermolecular
        interactions). In the present study, these limitations have been overcome to reveal the existence of a rich
        conformational polymorphism in the monomer of NPs and to demonstrate its link to amyloidogenesis and
        neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001335.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

        <p>To circumvent the first of the aforementioned limitations, we recently developed a novel strategy that uses a

          properties (plasmid for force spectroscopy-2 [pFS-2]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001335-g001">Figure
            1A</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Oroz1">[30]</xref>. Accordingly, unlike previous works
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Sandal1">[26]</xref>, by means of this approach (termed the
          “carrier-guest” strategy) the SMFS data obtained from the NP are always read after the unfolding of the
          carrier, far from the proximal region to the AFM substrate, which is known to be typically noisy and thus
          unreliable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001335-g001">Figure 1B</xref>;<xref

            S1</xref>;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001335.s018">Text S1</xref>). Whereas the
          conformational stability of the carrier proteins is reduced when they contain the guest NP, and in some
          preparations some molecules even lose their folded tertiary structure, the carriers essentially maintain their
          structure and mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001335.s015">Table
            S2</xref>), which enables the unambiguous observation of the conformational polymorphism of the monomeric
          NPs. Furthermore, regarding the possible presence of spurious interactions, in these studies we found no
          evidence of contacts or other interactions between the carrier and guest proteins beyond the covalent linkage
          of the polypeptide chain. This rules out the possibility of artifactual contacts, and hence a possible gain of
          structure, induced in the NPs when nested inside the carriers or the other way around.
        </p>
        <p>To the best of our knowledge, the pFS-2 vector is the first strategy capable of successfully avoiding the
          contamination of SMFS data with non-specific interactions from the proximal region of the AFM, which is
          particularly useful for studying IDPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Oroz1">[30]</xref>. Indeed, this
          approach guarantees that the selected data originate from the stretching of single NP molecules (<xref
            ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001335-g001">Figure 1</xref>). However, in principle, the stretching of a single
          NP monomer does not exclude possible interactions of the NP with the carrier, the AFM elements (substrate or
          tip) or other surrounding NPs (intermolecular interactions from oligomers and/or fibers). Such potential
          interactions (the third limitation of those SMFS studies listed above) must be ruled out before force events
          can be unequivocally attributed to intramolecular interactions in the NP monomers. By using specific controls,
          we provide compelling evidence that in our experimental conditions, the stringently selected SMFS data (we
          sampled about 100 molecules of each NP with each set of recordings resulting from 50,000–100,000 pulling
          attempts) exclusively arose from monomeric NPs and, therefore, represent bona fide intramolecular interactions
          (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001335.s018">Text S1</xref>).
        </p>
        <p>Finally, by restricting the degrees of freedom of the hosted NPs, the pFS-2 strategy has the additional
          advantage of dramatically slowing down fibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material"
                                                                        rid="pbio.1001335.s006">Figure S6D</xref>;<xref

        <p>PolyQ diseases are unique among amyloidogenic neurodegenerative diseases in that they are both genetically
          determined and their NPs, polyQ expansions, have pathological thresholds (21–30 and 36–40 glutamine residues
          in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 [SCA6] and Huntington disease, respectively). Interestingly, there is a
          positive correlation between the number of glutamine repeats and the severity of the disease, the age of
          onset, and the oligomerization kinetics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Nagai1">[4]</xref>,<xref

          determinants are expected to correlate with the number of glutamine residues. Using SMFS we looked for
          possible mechanical differences in the monomeric polyQ tracts of three lengths that are considered to be sub-,

              originating from different conformations adopted by the monomeric forms of NPs (as opposed to

        <p>Based on our current knowledge of NPs
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Chiti1">[1]</xref>
          and recent studies of polyQ tracts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Nagai2">[5]</xref>, it is likely
          that NM and M conformers correspond to RC and β-stranded structures, respectively (see<xref
            ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001335.s018">Text S1</xref>), as has been previously assumed

          Together, these results indicate that polyQ tracts of 35 glutamines can experience a structural transition
          that permits conformational fluctuations. Significantly, Q
          <sub>62</sub>
          exhibited even greater conformational polymorphism that also included a higher number of hM conformers (<xref
            ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001335-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, expanded polyQ tracts (Q
          <sub>35</sub>
          and Q<sub>62</sub>) allow the appearance of conformations that can be detected by SMFS; these mechanical
          conformations include hM conformers. This polymorphism (estimated as the frequency of M conformers, including
          hM ones) is positively correlated with the polyQ length, which in turn correlates with amyloidogenesis.
          Interestingly, a structural correlation with the pathological threshold for polyQs has been previously
          reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Nagai2">[5]</xref>.

          molecule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001335.s011">Figure S11</xref>), suggesting the
          presence of more than one structured region in the M conformers.
        </p>
        <p>It should be noted that the number (and thus the frequency) of M conformers may in reality be greater than
          that estimated due to the existence of additional SMFS curves that could correspond to incomplete recordings,
          i.e., compatible with the unfolding of a carrier bearing a mechanostable element that was not fully observed
          probably due to the premature detachment of the molecule. Although mechanostability is a stochastic property,
          these premature detachment events should often be lower than the forces needed to unravel the undetected NP
          (putative M conformers). A subset of these recordings contained putative hM events (<xref
            ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001335.s012">Figure S12</xref>). Although these putative events
          were not included in the sample size,<italic>n</italic>, it is interesting to note that there is a good
          correlation between the putative and detected hM events among the different NPs and conditions tested (<xref
            ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001335.s016">Table S3</xref>).
        </p>
        <p>Taken together, SMFS analysis revealed that whereas VAMP2, a non-neurotoxic IDP, always shows a low
          (undetectable) resistance to mechanical unfolding, all the NPs studied behaved similarly, displaying a high
          degree of mechanical conformational polymorphism that often included a few hM conformers. We postulate that
          this behavior is associated with amyloidogenesis and neurotoxicity, which, in agreement with previous results
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Nagai2">[5]</xref>, strongly suggests that a critical conformational
          change in the monomer leads to the generation of the first toxic NP species. Hence, we have tested this
          working hypothesis by studying four conditions in which the disease and/or amyloidogenesis are affected in two
          ways: diminished with a peptide that blocks the oligomerization process, an aggregation-defective mutant, or a
          peptide that inhibits the β-conformational change; and intensified by familial-disease mutations. According to
          our hypothesis, in these conditions the conformational polymorphism (and hM frequency) should be unaltered,
          abolished, decreased, or increased, respectively.

          be considered significant. To rule out any effect of QBP1 on Aβ42, higher concentrations of QBP1 (from 100 µM

          conformers contain such β-structures, as discussed below. These results extend previous observations of common

        developed a strategy to unequivocally analyze at the single-molecule level the conformational polymorphism of
        IDPs, and in particular NPs. Accordingly, we have sampled the conformational space with about 100 molecules from
        each of the four most representative NPs and their variants: polyQ tracts, Aβ42, α-synuclein and Sup35NM (see
        <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001335-t001">Table 1</xref>). We demonstrate that proteins (neurotoxic or not)
        that do not form amyloid fibers (i.e., non-pathological polyQ tracts such as Q<sub>19</sub>, VAMP2, and the
        F19S/L34P Aβ42 mutant) show no mechanical conformational polymorphism, as monitored by SMFS. By contrast,
        proteins with propensity to form amyloid fibers (expanded polyQs, Sup35NM, and wt and familial-disease mutations
        for Aβ42 and α-synuclein) exhibit a rich conformational polymorphism that includes rare hM conformers.

      <p>As mentioned, it is likely that NM and M conformers correspond to RC and β-stranded structures, respectively.
        In the case of prions, conformers separated by a high-energy barrier and stabilized by strong non-covalent

        of conformations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Wiltzius1">[44]</xref>. It is tempting to speculate that
        these structures may contain β-strands in a shear (rather than zipper) configuration, as this is the most

        reduced the frequency of M (and hM) conformers in A53T α-synuclein and Sup35NM. Intriguingly, this treatment did
        not affect the conformational polymorphism of Arc Aβ42. Moreover, incubation of Aβ42 with SV111 yielded a

        conformers, of the relevant NPs. We show that this polymorphism can be altered in both directions, towards more
        “structured” conformers by pathological mutations or towards the NM conformation, by the QBP1 inhibitor and by
        non-fibrillogenic mutations. The dramatic reduction of the frequency of M conformers, including hM forms,
        produced by QBP1 suggests that hM conformers and/or their precursors from the M pool are good candidates to
        represent the primary cause of neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., the hypothetical initial misfolded
        intermediate). Since QBP1 inhibits the formation of these conformers and exerts anti-neurodegenerative effect
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Popiel1">[41]</xref>, we conclude that hM conformers, and/or their
        precursors, are likely on-pathway intermediates in amyloidogenesis and/or cytotoxicity. The discovery of these
        common features offers hope that a single therapeutic agent may be able to prevent, halt, or reverse the
        development of many neurodegenerative diseases arising from these different proteins.

        and their pathological and non-pathological variants. This approach permits—for the first time to our
        knowledge—rare hM conformers to be unequivocally detected. We postulate that these conformers, or their
        precursors, may mediate the primary event in the pathological cascade leading to amyloid fiber formation and
        concomitant neurodegenerative disease. On the basis of these findings, we propose the self-explanatory term
        “proteinoscleroses” to collectively refer to amyloid-related neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, hM
        conformers (or their earliest precursors, if we assume a sequential pathway) constitute ideal pharmacological
        targets and biomarkers of the propensity to develop such diseases. Moreover, the conformational inhibitor QBP1
        appears to target the pathway that leads to hM conformer formation in expanded polyQs, α-synuclein, and Sup35NM
        prion.
      </p>
      <p>Whereas there is evidence for rapid interconversion of conformers in NPs<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                       rid="pbio.1001335-Ferreon1">
        [21]</xref>, we propose that once formed, the hM conformers are likely to be kinetically trapped (because of the
        high energy unfolding barriers) and might mechanically jam the unfoldases of the protein-processing machinery of
        the cell as postulated previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-CarrinVzquez2">[51]</xref>. Such an
        effect would slow down their processing, which would unbalance the cell proteostasis by increasing the cytosolic
        concentration of hM conformers. This imbalance could affect distinct cellular processes and ultimately, it may
        lead to the formation of oligomers and amyloid fibers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material"

        or affect the normal lysosomal autophagy process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Li3">[56]</xref>. It
        should also be noted that the causal relationships between misfolding and oxidative stress remain a matter of
        debate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Andersen1">[57]</xref>. In spite of this, it must be noted that,
        alternatively, hM conformers may represent dead-end species, i.e., by-products, off-pathway of amyloidogenesis
        and cytotoxicity; in this case the toxic species would be part of the remaining species of the M pool.
      </p>
      <p>In conclusion, our findings show a clear correlation in all NPs studied between conformational polymorphism
        (including the presence of hM conformers) and neurotoxicity. They strongly indicate that hM events represent
        highly collapsed or structured conformers in the fibrillization pathway and that these conformers, or their
        precursors, may be the primary cause of amyloid-related neurodegenerative diseases. Our approach opens the door
        to understanding the molecular mechanism of amyloidogenesis and developing a single therapeutic strategy that
        may treat distinct neurodegenerative diseases using a single drug. Our novel approach also offers a new means of
        studying other proteins involved in conformational diseases and should allow the dissection (by using the
        appropriate conditions) of the toxicity and fibrillogenic pathways involved in amyloidogenesis.

            has allowed us to observe a high degree of conformational polymorphism in different NPs, comprising
            conformations with no detectable mechanical stability (NM conformers, that exhibit no force peaks in SMFS)
            and M conformations (with at least one force peak), the latter including the subset of hM conformers (with
            at least one force peak with<italic>F</italic>≥400 pN). As discussed in the main text, it is reasonable to
            assume that both M and hM conformers are β-structured. These different conformers are thought to be in a
            highly dynamic equilibrium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Ferreon1">[21]</xref>; however, once
            formed the hM conformers may be kinetically trapped by a high unfolding barrier. We tentatively propose a
            plausible mechanism of cytotoxicity in which hM conformers mechanically block the cell's protein-processing
            machinery leading to an increase in their cytosolic concentration and affecting multiple cellular processes,
            which ultimately results in the formation of oligomers and amyloid fibers. These hM conformers may originate
            sequentially from less toxic intermediate β-structured conformations (on-pathway) or they may trigger the
            disease through a pathway other than that proposed here. Alternatively, hM conformers may represent
            kinetically trapped by-products of the amyloidogenic/cytotoxic pathway. The steps blocked by the two
            inhibitor peptides used in this study are indicated: QBP1 blocks the conformational change and displaces the
            putative RC/β-structure equilibrium towards the RC conformer (thereby interrupting the pathogenic cascade in
            its earliest stages), while SV111 inhibits the oligomerization of the β-hairpin monomers of Aβ42<xref

            [9]</xref>. Accordingly, we found that α-synuclein and ubi+α-synuclein showed α-helical structure in the
            presence of 1 mM SDS. When isolated or as a guest with ubiquitin, α-synucleins acquire β-structure, during
            incubation at 37°C, an effect that is suppressed or slowed down by the presence of QBP1 (right). (B) The 1H
            NMR spectra of A53T α-synuclein (blue) and ubi+A53T α-synuclein (red) are largely comparable, except for
            very slight changes (mainly at &lt;1 ppm and ∼8 ppm). This indicates that the behavior of A53T α-synuclein
            is similar when isolated or inserted into ubiquitin and no strong interactions occur between the two
            proteins in the carrier-guest protein. Furthermore, the chemical shift values of the resonances in the
            upfield region in the<sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra for ubi+MCS (black) and ubi+A53T α-synuclein (red) are very
            similar. Since these values are exquisitely sensitive to local environment, this similarity is conclusive
            evidence that the hydrophobic core packing in ubiquitin is unaffected by the presence of the A53T
            α-synuclein guest. In the spectrum, the broader lines of ubiquitin carrying the A53T α-synuclein guest
            relative to ubi+MCS are consistent with the larger size and slower tumbling of the former (right). A53T
            α-synuclein lacks the upfield signals and its complete<sup>1</sup>H spectrum is typical of a RC. The
            residues assigned correspond to the folded ubiquitin structure<xref ref-type="bibr"

            (A) Far-UV CD spectra (left), and estimated increase in β-structure content during the incubation at 37°C
            (right). The CD spectra indicate that the Sup35NM prion remains disordered when fused to the I27 carrier
            module (the CD spectrum of I27+Sup35NM closely resembles the sum of I27 and Sup35NM spectra weighted by the
            relative contribution of their respective sequences to the fusion protein). Whereas the spectrum at 5 d
            (inset) shows features indicating that RC conformations are still predominant, spectral analysis reveals a
            significant increase in β-structure (right panel). Remarkably, the CD spectrum at 5 d has lost the majority
            of its intensity, possibly because of oligomerization and the formation of insoluble aggregates (see [C]).
            QBP1 (20 µM) appears to suppress these oligomerization processes and to reduce the formation of β-structure.
            Apparently, I27+Sup35NM acquires more β-structure than the isolated Sup35NM. This could be attributed to the
            positioning of the NP termini in close proximity when it is nested within I27, which might encourage the
            formation of contacts. (B) The<sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of I27-MCS (black), Sup35NM (blue), and I27+Sup35NM
            (red) are shown on the left with an expanded view of the HN resonances on the right. The line broadening of
            the I27+Sup35NM spectrum is more evident than that observed for the other carrier-guest proteins examined (

            being the largest guest studied (which is in a RC conformation) and/or the formation of the oligomers and
            aggregates inferred by CD (A). Therefore, to confirm that the native structure of the I27 carrier is
            maintained, a 2D<sup>1</sup>H NOESY spectrum was recorded. In this spectrum, signals arising from the
            packing of aliphatic and aromatic groups in the native hydrophobic core of I27 were observed and rigorously
            assigned, thus allowing us to conclude that the native conformation of I27 is still compatible with the
            Sup35NM graft (data not shown). (C) Aggregation of Sup35NM samples. Sup35NM, either isolated or fused to the
            I27 carrier, aggregated over the incubation period at 37°C. The presence of QBP1 impedes (or at least
            reduces) aggregation of Sup35NM. (D) TEM images of Sup35NM (1), Sup35NM+QBP1 (2), I27+Sup35NM (3),

            observed after a 32-d incubation at 37°C, while samples for panels 6–8 were incubated for 29 d at 4°C. The
            concentrations of pFS-2 polyprotein, carrier-guest protein, guest protein, and QBP1 were 20, 10, 10, and 20
            µM, respectively. The presence of amyloid fibers was reduced by QBP1 peptide, both in Sup35NM (2) and
            I27+Sup35NM (4) samples, although fibers remained visible. Amyloid formation was reduced at 4°C (the

            <bold>Putative additional hM events.</bold>
            (A) Example of an event considered as a putative hM. In gray we show the force peak due to the unfolding of
            the carrier module (C) and a region of the NP that is shorter than its full length. The Δ
            <italic>L</italic>
            <sub>c</sub>
            value associated with this force peak is larger than that of a normal ubiquitin repeat but not as large as
            that expected if the entire NP was stretched. To explain these frequent events, we assume that the
            polyprotein attachments (either from the tip or the substrate) were not maintained until the end of the
            experiment (i.e., the polyprotein molecule may have detached before reaching the forces required to fully
            unfold the region trapped<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001335-Dougan1">[28]</xref>). Therefore, it is
            reasonable to assume that its mechanical stability would be higher than the force of detachment (last peak
            in the spectrum, indicated by the arrow). (B–E) Force of detachment values for the recordings considered to
            contain putative additional events for polyQ tracts, Aβ42, α-synuclein, and Sup35NM, respectively. Putative
            hM events (with detachment forces ≥400 pN) are shown in black. This analysis suggests that the population of
            hM conformers observed directly in our study represents an under-estimate of the actual propensity of the
            NPs to form these conformers. Thus, it appears that SMFS experiments miss a considerable fraction of hM
            conformers owing to the experimental approach, which seems to filter out several hM events. These data were
            not included in our sample size (n). In (B–E) each vertical bar represents a single event (one molecule).
            Note that Q<sub>62+</sub>QBP1 and Sup35NM+QBP1 yielded no putative hM events and therefore are not
            represented here.

            corresponding NP shading starts at the same position but extends differently. The first yellow shaded area
            corresponds to Q<sub>19</sub>, while Q

            different residues in the protein used, which do not belong to the guest sequence (i.e., purification tags

            VLXT and VL3 use different parameters and window sizes, and were trained on very different datasets; as a
            result, their predictions differ considerably, especially for longer NPs ([F] α-synuclein and [G] Sup35NM).
            Nonetheless, all the NPs (except polyQ tracts, as discussed in<xref ref-type="supplementary-material"
