      <p>After the publication of this article, a number of concerns were raised in relation to different aspects of the research reported. The <italic>PLOS ONE</italic> editors carried out an evaluation of the history of the manuscript, which revealed that due to a failure in the peer review process, several aspects of the research were not adequately evaluated before publication.</p>
      <p>As a result, the <italic>PLOS ONE</italic> editors have undertaken a thorough re-examination of this study, involving both external and internal advisers. This assessment has revealed the following concerns regarding the study:</p>
      <list list-type="alpha-lower">
        <list-item>
          <p>The description of the alleles in the article is inadequate.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>There are concerns over the study design employed to study the association; a single-gene association study based on Cox-2 or a genome-wide association study have been recommended as more appropriate approaches to study this association.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>The validity of the control population employed in the study is compromised as it involved a different breed.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>There are concerns about the strength of the evidence shown to support an association between the Cox-2 variant and the dogs' phenotypes, as the evidence from other breeds suggests that this may be a neutral DNA variant.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>In the light of the concerns outlined above, the <italic>PLOS ONE</italic> editors are issuing this Expression of Concern in order to make readers aware of the concerns about the reliability of the results and conclusions reported in the article.</p>
