      <p>By any measure it has been a huge year for the open-access movement. At the beginning of the year, it looked
        possible that the public access policy of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) might be rolled back by the
        Research Works Act, a legislative attempt supported by Elsevier and the Association of American Publishers to
        make such policies illegal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001417-Wikipedia1">[1]</xref>. But as we move towards
        year's end, the momentum behind open access looks unstoppable with the announcement of major policy initiatives
        in the United States, the European Union, Denmark, and the United Kingdom (see<xref ref-type="table"
                                                                                            rid="pbio-1001417-t001">

        agencies, policy makers, and open-access publishers with an opportunity to discuss, publicize, and advocate for
        open access. With this year's successes, it is also a good time to reflect on and to consider how we ensure that
        the promise of open access is delivered. But if we are to exploit the potential that open access provides, we
        must look beyond just making research findings accessible to ensuring that they are legally and technically
        available for re-use.
      </p>
      <p>Ten years ago, the authors of the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI)
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001417-Chan1">[8]</xref>
        saw this potential clearly and agreed upon a text that has stood the test of time:
      </p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>By “open access" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any
          users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl
          them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial,
          legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only
          constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give
          authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.
        </p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>This definition, which could be used to describe the Creative Commons Attribution license (CC-BY)<xref
        ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001417-Creative1">[9]</xref>, was written nearly a year before the release of the
        first Creative Commons licenses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001417-Creative2">[10]</xref>. PLOS has used
        CC-BY as its standard license since the publication of its first paper and has supported the principles of full
        open access throughout its history<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001417-Carroll1">[11]</xref>. In September
        2011, 10 years after the original BOAI meeting, the BOAI10 group released a new set of recommendations<xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001417-Budapest1">[12]</xref>, which explicitly describe the use of CC-BY as best
        practice. The policies of funding agencies are also increasingly raising the issue of licensing<xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001417-Research2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001417-Wellcome1">
          [6]</xref>. But why focus on an esoteric legal instrument? Why does licensing matter if we are within sight of
        making sure that the public can access and read research articles?
      </p>
      <p>Mere access is not enough to deliver on the promise of a truly network-enabled research communication system.
        The Creative Commons license says that: “You are free: to Share…to Remix…to make commercial use of this work"
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001417-Creative1">[9]</xref>. This is a “liberal" or “permissive" license,
        meaning that it does not place any restrictions on the forms of re-use that are allowed. This is consistent with
        the Budapest Declaration: “The only […] role for copyright […] should be to give authors […] the right to be
        properly acknowledged […]". Anyone can read the article, but they can also re-use it, in whole or in part for
        any purpose, including commercial use.
      </p>
      <p>People sometimes struggle with this idea of someone else commercially exploiting their research, and many
        publishers expressly forbid it. It
        <italic>is</italic>
        sometimes difficult to stomach the idea of allowing others to profit from our work, but the reason it is
        important to enable commercial re-use helps to illustrate a deeper principle about optimizing our use of the web
        for publishing research. There are at least two realities to the commercialization of academic research. The
        first is that it is far more likely that someone other than the original research team has the best opportunity
        to make money out of a specific piece of research. The human genome project generated US$141 for every dollar
        spent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001417-Gitlin1">[13]</xref>, but this immense return is widely distributed
        as a result of thousands of people's work. It is rare for research teams to have both the academic and business
        expertise required for commercial exploitation, and they typically require a commercial partner. Open-access
        publishing effectively increases our chances of finding those potential partners. If we restrict their capacity
        to use our research by restricting commercial use, we limit the chances of partners, commercial or otherwise,
        finding and contacting us.
      </p>
      <p>The second reality is that most commercial products are based on multiple pieces of research, not just one.
        This renders untenable the argument that noncommercial licensing terms are acceptable because a potential
        commercial user “can always ask". The same argument is often advanced about data sharing. But most people just
        won't bother asking. In many cases, innovation comes from combining many data sets. It doesn't take too long
        before it becomes impossible to ask every data holder personally for their permission. Would you want to answer
        every query? How many could you deal with? One a week? One a day? One an hour?
      </p>
      <p>The whole point of the web is that it exists on a massive scale and the potential value of a network rises as
        the square of its size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001417-Wikipedia3">[14]</xref>. If we want to exploit the
        web fully for research, we have to think about exploiting its full scale. And that means asking whether the
        mechanisms we have in place can work at that scale. Personally asking for and granting permission on a
        case-by-case basis does not.
      </p>
      <p>We need to move from controlling access and permissions to assuring people that they have access and permission
        with systems that don't require our intervention. The focus should be on enabling and encouraging unexpected
        uses and re-uses of our research. Making things accessible is a necessary step to make this happen, but it is
        not sufficient. We must also give potential users the confidence that they have sufficient rights to do what
        they want. The Creative Commons Attribution license is a good way of achieving this. Even so, providing
        assurance of the rights to re-use research is still not sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>We also need to ensure that re-use is technically easy. Here there is a significant opportunity to do better.
        At PLOS we provide all our content in the form of machine-readable XML, but we generally provide figures in flat
        image formats, reducing the opportunity for data mining. The whole industry could do better by agreeing on
        standard tag sets and shared systems for the annotation of papers. And we need to do a whole lot better on
        describing and linking to supplementary data.
      </p>
      <p>When we have these three elements, accessibility, rights, and ease of use, at web scale, then amazing things
        can happen. When resources and information are embedded in worldwide networks, new kinds of research become
        possible. Participatory science projects like Fold-It (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fold.it"
                                                                         xlink:type="simple">http://fold.it</ext-link>)
        and GalaxyZoo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org/" xlink:type="simple">
          http://www.galaxyzoo.org/</ext-link>) are commonly used examples, but others, such as the explosive growth of
        bioinformatics as a result of online accessibility of public domain data, are often forgotten. And there are
        many smaller stories of new connections and projects that have been made possible only because research is
        easily shareable and useable.
      </p>
      <p>These are really only glimpses of what is possible. The utter transformation of commerce and media that we have
        seen over the past decade is just starting to take hold in our research work and publishing systems. To realize
        the full potential, we need to move our agenda beyond merely making things accessible and readable to ensuring
        that re-use rights are clear, and that technical usability is continuously improving.
      </p>
      <p>And we need to start today. We need to start because the success of open access means that more research is
        accessible than ever before. It is incumbent on us to show real benefits from that availability. The rapid
        growth in the number of open-access articles we have seen over the past few years is only going to accelerate as
        policy initiatives kick in. We will soon have the critical mass of accessible literature that could support the
        true transformation of scholarly communication.
      </p>
      <p>Mere access is not enough to deliver on the promise of a truly network-enabled research communication system.
        As open access moves beyond an aspiration to reality, we need to ensure that what is accessible is truly
        useable, both legally and technically. As we celebrate the gains, and they are real and serious gains<xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001417-Wikipedia4">[15]</xref>, let us also keep our eyes on the horizon so that we
        deliver what we have promised. We need to ensure that licensing is addressed in funder and institutional
        policies. We need to keep challenging ourselves to improve the technical usability of our publishing platforms
        and to enable others to experiment. Above all, we need to understand and appreciate what it means to build
        networked systems that scale to exploit the web. We have promised the world. Now it's time to deliver.
